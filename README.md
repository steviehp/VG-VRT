Vestibular Rehabilitation Therapy (VRT) is used to treat patients with vestibular (inner ear/balance) disorders. However, VRT requires repetitive eye and head movements designed to retrain the system. These monotonous movements may cause discomfort, which could result in patients stopping the exercises. In order to increase effectiveness and enjoyment, the development of game-based, virtual reality (VR) therapy was explored. Using the current vestibular rehabilitation therapies as a base, the VRT exercises were researched and integrated into virtual reality as a potential alternative therapy. This paper discusses how the VRT exercises were integrated into VR and tested on college students for enjoyment, as well explains how these VRT exercises were chosen and which part of the vestibular system is stimulated through them. Through this study, it was concluded that VR may be able to be used as a potential form of VRT through enjoyment; however, it will need to be tested with patients with vestibular disorders to see if it is an effective treatment.
